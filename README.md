The concept of this game:
I want to create a game that would represent the society problem nowadays. I choose to design visual elements to be adorable in contrast to the story. This story reflect how society impact on a person. The little duck is a symbol of a person who finding himself/herself and trying to blend into the group. Unfortunately, not all people will be accepeted into the group and some people is also not accepeted by what people called 'family'. So what will happen to those people? You can find the answer in 'The Lost Duck'.


This project was developed during Nov - Dec 2021 as a part of Computer Programming course.
